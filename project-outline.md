# Model Comparison Studio - Complete Project Summary

## Application Overview
A personal web-based tool for testing and evaluating AI language models side-by-side. The primary use case is comparing new LLMs against established favorites to build a personal knowledge base of model performance across different prompts and use cases.

## Core Features

### Model Management
- **Manual Model Addition**: Input field for adding models by ID (format: `provider/model-name`)
- **Auto-Fetch Metadata**: Automatically retrieve context window size from nano-gpt API when adding models
- **Pill-Based Selection**: Visual pill interface for selecting up to 3 models for comparison
- **Persistent Storage**: Save added models locally in JSON format for future use
- **Model Library**: Accumulate models over time with quick access to frequently used ones

### Comparison Workflow
- **Prompt Input**: Large text area for entering test prompts
- **Parallel Execution**: Send identical prompts to selected models simultaneously
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Display responses as they arrive from each model
- **Response Panels**: Three side-by-side panels showing model outputs
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during response generation

### Evaluation System
- **Rating Scale**: 1-10 star rating system for each response
- **Comments**: Text field for detailed evaluation notes per response
- **Performance Metrics**: Display response time and token count from API metadata
- **Historical Tracking**: Build personal knowledge base of model performance over time

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (Minimal API approach)
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage
- **API Provider**: nano-gpt.com as sole model provider
- **Authentication**: API keys stored in appsettings.json (single-user application)

### Data Storage
- **Models**: ID, name, context window, metadata, last used timestamp
- **Responses**: Prompt text, model ID, response content, timestamp, performance metrics
- **Ratings**: Score (1-10), comment text, linked to specific responses
- **Sessions**: Comparison history and user preferences

### API Integration
- **nano-gpt Integration**: Single provider with extensive model catalog
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response display as content arrives
- **Metadata Extraction**: Response time, token counts, model-specific metrics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual models fail

## User Experience

### Interface Design
- **Dark Theme**: Modern, clean interface matching reference designs
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Purple Accents**: Consistent color scheme for selected states and actions
- **Loading Animations**: Smooth transitions and progress indicators

### Workflow Optimization
- **Quick Model Selection**: Efficient pill-based model switching
- **Instant Comparison**: One-click prompt execution across selected models
- **Rapid Evaluation**: Simple rating and commenting system
- **Knowledge Building**: Easy reference to past evaluations and notes

## MVP Scope

### Included Features
- Manual model ID input with auto-metadata fetch
- 3-model simultaneous comparison
- Basic rating and commenting system
- Local data persistence
- Response time tracking
- Simple, clean UI

### Excluded from MVP
- Multi-user support or authentication
- Advanced analytics or trend analysis
- Export functionality or reporting
- Prompt template library
- Dynamic model discovery
- Advanced filtering or search

## Implementation Notes

### API Configuration
- Single nano-gpt API configuration
- API keys in appsettings.json
- Model metadata caching for performance
- Rate limiting awareness

### Data Persistence
- SQLite for simplicity and portability
- JSON configuration for model library
- Local storage for user preferences
- Backup/restore consideration for future

### Performance Considerations
- Concurrent API calls to multiple models
- Response streaming for real-time updates
- Efficient state management in vanilla JS
- Minimal dependencies for fast loading

## Personal Use Case Alignment
This tool directly supports your current manual evaluation process by:
- Replacing handwritten notes with structured data
- Enabling quick comparison of new models against trusted ones
- Building searchable knowledge base of model performance
- Streamlining the evaluation workflow for faster decision-making

The application serves as a personal productivity tool for AI model evaluation, designed specifically for rapid testing and knowledge accumulation rather than collaborative or enterprise features.
