Important .NET coding standards:

*   **Strive for Simplicity and Clarity:** Code should be simple, clear, and self-documented, using good names for methods and variables, and respecting SOLID principles.
*   **Follow Naming Conventions:** Use PascalCasing for all public member, type, and namespace names, and camelCasing for parameter names.
*   **Provide Meaningful Comments:** Public classes, methods, and properties should be commented to explain their external usage.
*   **Adhere to the DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid copying and pasting code. Instead, decouple reusable parts into shared components or libraries.
*   **Maintain a High Maintainability Index:** Regularly refactor code to elevate its maintainability index, which includes writing classes/methods with single responsibilities, avoiding duplicate code, and limiting method length.
*   **Control Cyclomatic Complexity:** Ensure methods have a cyclomatic complexity score below 10. Refactor complex methods (e.g., those with deep nested loops or many `if-else` or `switch` statements) into smaller, more focused methods.
*   **Manage Class Coupling:** Aim for low class coupling (e.g., a maximum of nine instances suggested by Microsoft) to reduce dependencies, often achieved through the use of interfaces.
*   **Limit Code Lines per Class/Method:** Avoid excessively long classes (e.g., over 1,000 lines) or methods, as this often indicates poor design and a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.
*   **Utilize a Version Control System:** A version control system is an essential tool for all software development projects to ensure code integrity, track history, and support branching and merging.
*   **Implement Robust Exception Handling:** Use `try-catch` statements concisely for specific exceptions, integrate them with logging solutions, and **never use empty `try-catch` blocks**, which can hide critical issues.
*   **Ensure Proper Resource Disposal:** Always use the `using` statement or implement the `IDisposable` interface for objects that manage unmanaged resources (e.g., I/O objects) to prevent memory leaks.
*   **Perform Null Object Checking:** Implement checks for null objects using mechanisms like nullable reference types (available since C# 8) to prevent unexpected runtime errors.
*   **Use Constants and Enumerators:** Replace "magic numbers" and hardcoded text with well-defined constants and enumerators for better readability and maintainability.
*   **Avoid Unsafe Code:** Unsafe code, which involves pointers, should be avoided unless it is the only viable way to implement a solution.
*   **Provide Default `switch-case` Treatment:** Always include a `default` case in `switch-case` statements to handle any unhandled input gracefully.
*   **Apply Multithreading Best Practices:** If multithreading is necessary, carefully plan the number of threads, use concurrent collections, manage static variables (e.g., with `[ThreadStatic]` or `AsyncLocal<T>`), and ensure threads are properly terminated. Favor `async/await` for its ease of use and deterministic behavior.
*   **Leverage Dependency Injection (DI):** Use DI for cleaner code, easier management of object lifetimes, and seamless integration of logging.
*   **Prioritize Performance Optimization:** Implement techniques such as backend caching, asynchronous programming, efficient object allocation, and database query optimization (e.g., filtering columns and rows) to achieve desired system performance.
*   **Apply SOLID Design Principles:** Follow the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) as fundamental guidelines for designing robust, flexible, and maintainable software architecture.
*   **Integrate Code Analysis Tools:** Utilize static code analysis tools (e.g., Code Metrics, Code Style, Code Cleanup, SonarAnalyzer, SonarLint) as part of the development workflow to automatically enforce coding standards and identify potential issues during design time.
