Always follow the following best practices when coding:

1.  **Prioritize Simplicity and Readability**: Reduce ambiguities, clarify processes, and use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables to make code self-documenting.
2.  **Adhere to SOLID Principles**: Respect Single Responsibility, Open/Close, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles to organize functions and data structures effectively.
3.  **Ensure High Maintainability**: Refactor code to improve its maintainability index (a score from 0 to 100, where higher indicates easier maintenance), focusing on writing classes and methods with single responsibilities.
4.  **Limit Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep the cyclomatic complexity of methods below 10. Higher numbers indicate code that is difficult to read and maintain, suggesting that such methods should be refactored into separate methods or classes.
5.  **Achieve High Cohesion and Low Coupling**: Design solutions where classes are not closely and directly connected (low coupling) and where each class has well-related methods and data (high cohesion). Prefer composition or aggregation over inheritance if appropriate to reduce dependencies and tight coupling.
6.  **Avoid Duplicate Code**: Ensure there is no reason for having duplicate code, and centralize reusable logic where possible.
7.  **Avoid Large Code files**: If a code file exceeds 400 lines of code, refactor it's logic into smaller, seperate but logic code files.
8.  **Implement Robust Exception Handling**: Avoid empty `try-catch` blocks, as they hide unexpected behavior. Connect `try-catch` statements to logging solutions, and catch specific exceptions whenever possible rather than general ones to prevent hiding unexpected errors and application crashes.
9.  **Properly Manage Resources with `using` and `IDisposable`**: Always use the `using` statement (or `try-finally`) to correctly create and destroy I/O objects (like `StreamWriter`) and all other disposable objects to prevent memory leaks and ensure resources are freed gracefully. Implement the `IDisposable` pattern for classes that deal with and create objects requiring explicit disposal.
10. **Manage Object Allocation Carefully**: Avoid allocating large objects and be cautious with event handling and weak references to minimize the Garbage Collector's impact on performance and prevent memory issues.
11. **Utilize Dependency Injection (DI)**: Employ DI for cleaner code. With DI, you generally only need to worry about disposing of objects you explicitly create, not those injected. DI also facilitates injecting `ILogger` for debugging exceptions. Choose appropriate service lifetimes (Singleton, Scoped, Transient) based on business rules and object state.
12. **Perform Null Checking and Use Nullable Reference Types**: Always check objects for null before usage. C# 8's nullable reference types can help prevent related errors.
13. **Use Constants and Enumerators**: Replace "magic numbers" and literal text with constants and enumerators for better readability and maintainability.
14. **Comment Public Methods Thoroughly**: Provide comments for public methods to explain their correct external usage, especially since they are used outside your library.
15. **Include Default Treatment in `switch-case` Statements**: Include a `default` case in `switch-case` statements to handle unknown input variables and prevent code breaks.

17. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY Principle)**: Follow the DRY principle by analyzing your code and selecting parts that can be decoupled and reused, rather than copying and pasting code. Centralize common logic to ensure consistency and easier maintenance.
18. **Leverage Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) Principles for Reuse**: Utilize C# capabilities like inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism to build highly reusable code components.
19. **Utilize Generics for Flexible Code Reuse**: Implement generics in interfaces, classes, methods, or delegates to define placeholders for specific types, maximizing type safety, performance, and code reuse with different data types.
20. **Proactively Refactor Code**: Refactor code that is not well-tested, duplicated, too complex to understand, or tightly coupled. Refactoring improves software design, makes code easier to understand, helps find bugs, and cleans up the design, while ensuring the original behavior is preserved.

22. **Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Organize applications into **Bounded Contexts** to cope with complex software systems by defining distinct domain models and ubiquitous languages for different parts of an organization, which helps manage complexity and reduce discrepancies.
23. **Use Value Objects and Aggregates in DDD**: Employ Value Objects for data with no unique identities, and Aggregates to represent complex entities and their related objects as single units, with a unique aggregate root handling all operations on the aggregate.
24. **Implement Domain Events for Inter-Context Communication**: Use **Domain Events**, often via the Publisher/Subscriber pattern, for communication among Bounded Contexts. This approach maximizes independence between contexts by allowing publishers to broadcast information without needing to know specific subscribers.
25. **Apply Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: When data storage/update requirements differ significantly from query requirements, use the CQRS pattern. This involves using different structures for storing/updating and querying data, which can lead to more efficient and specialized solutions.
26. ****Avoid Sync-over-Async**: Never use `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` or `.Wait()` on async methods - always propagate `async/await` up the call chain to prevent deadlocks. 
27. **Don't Fake Async**: Only use `async/await` for truly asynchronous I/O operations, not CPU-bound work that completes immediately.
